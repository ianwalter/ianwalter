# Spotlight on vuex-reset

[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) makes it easy to manage the app-wide state for a
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) application, but there is no built-in way to easily
reset that state to it’s initial value. That’s where
[vuex-reset](https://github.com/ianwalter/vuex-reset) comes in. It’s a small
Vuex plugin that will allow you to reset a store and/or store module(s) to it’s
initial state by calling a special reset mutation.

At binx health we're always trying to think of ways we can prevent leaking user
information. We use vuex-reset to clear user information after it’s not needed
anymore, like when a customer has finished placing an order or has logged out.
Although that data is not accessible outside of our application, clearing that
data provides a secondary safeguard around leaking that information in ways we
did not intend.

Security isn’t the only use-case, though. The utility is generally useful
whenever you need to reset state without having to write more code to do so.
Let's look at an example in which a form has it's fields bound to a Vuex
module's state:
