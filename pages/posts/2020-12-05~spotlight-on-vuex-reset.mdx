# Spotlight on vuex-reset

[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) makes it easy to manage the app-wide state for a
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) application, but there is no built-in way to easily
reset that state to it’s initial value. That’s where
[vuex-reset](https://github.com/ianwalter/vuex-reset) comes in. It’s a small
Vuex plugin that will allow you to reset a store and/or store module(s) to it’s
initial state by calling a special reset mutation.

At binx health we're always trying to think of ways we can prevent leaking user
information. We use vuex-reset to clear user information after it’s not needed
anymore, like when a customer has finished placing an order or has logged out.
Although that data is not accessible outside of our application, clearing that
data provides a secondary safeguard around leaking that information in ways we
did not intend.

Security isn’t the only use-case, though. The utility is generally useful
whenever you need to reset state without having to write more code to do so.
Let's look at an example in which a form has it's fields bound to a Vuex
module's state:

```js
import Vuex from 'vuex'
import VuexReset from '@ianwalter/vuex-reset'

// Create a Vuex store.
export default new Vuex.Store({
  // Add the vuex-reset plugin to the store.
  plugins: [VuexReset()],
  modules: {
    // The colorScheme module has initial values that we may want to
    // reset to at some point.
    colorScheme: {
      namespaced: true,
      state: {
        name: 'Default',
        colors: [
          '#ff8080',
          '#95ffa4',
          '#ffe9aa',
          '#91ddff',
          '#c991e1'
        ]
      },
      mutations: {
      	// We need to add a dummy reset mutation so we can trigger
        // the reset when desired.
        reset: () => {},
        // Here is an example mutation that can be used to update the
        // colorScheme values.
        save: (state, colorScheme) => Object.assign(state, colorScheme)
      }
    }
  }
})
```
