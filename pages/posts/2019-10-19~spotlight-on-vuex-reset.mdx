# Spotlight on vuex-reset

[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) makes it easy to manage the app-wide state for
a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) application, but there is no built-in way to
easily reset that state to it’s initial value. That’s where
[vuex-reset](https://github.com/ianwalter/vuex-reset) comes in. It’s a small
Vuex plugin that will allow you to reset a store and/or store module(s) to it’s
initial state by calling a special reset mutation.

At [binx health](https://mybinxhealth.com) we're always trying to think of ways
we can prevent leaking user information. We use vuex-reset to clear user
information after it’s not needed anymore, like when a customer has finished
placing an order or has logged out. Although that data is not accessible outside
of our application, clearing that data provides a secondary safeguard around
leaking that information in ways we did not intend.

Security isn’t the only use-case, though. The utility is generally useful
whenever you need to reset state without having to write more code to do so.
Let's look at an example in which a form has it's fields bound to a Vuex
module's state:

```js
import Vuex from 'vuex'
import VuexReset from '@ianwalter/vuex-reset'

// Create a Vuex store.
export default new Vuex.Store({
  // Add the vuex-reset plugin to the store.
  plugins: [VuexReset()],
  modules: {
    // The colorScheme module has initial values that we may want to
    // reset to at some point.
    colorScheme: {
      namespaced: true,
      state: {
        name: 'Default',
        colors: [
          '#ff8080',
          '#95ffa4',
          '#ffe9aa',
          '#91ddff',
          '#c991e1'
        ]
      },
      mutations: {
      	// We need to add a dummy reset mutation so we can trigger
        // the reset when desired.
        reset: () => {},
        // Here is an example mutation that can be used to update the
        // colorScheme values.
        save: (state, colorScheme) => Object.assign(state, colorScheme)
      }
    }
  }
})
```

<CodeCaption>
  store.js
</CodeCaption>

```js
export default {
  data () {
    // Copy the color scheme stored in the Vuex module to the
    // component's data so it can be used as the default value
    // in the imaginary New Color Scheme form.
    return { colorScheme: this.$store.state.colorScheme }
    },
    methods: {
    save () {
      // Save the new color scheme values from the imaginary New
      // Color Scheme form to the store.
      this.$store.commit('colorScheme/save', this.colorScheme)
    },
    reset () {
      // Reset the color scheme to the initial 'Default' color scheme.
      this.$store.commit('colorScheme/reset')
    }
  }
}
```

<CodeCaption>
  NewColorScheme.vue
</CodeCaption>

When a user first navigates to the imaginary New Color Scheme form in the
`NewColorScheme.vue` component the default values will be the initial values in
the Vuex `colorScheme` module. They can then modify the name and colors of the
color scheme and click a save button which would save those updated values to
the store. If they ever wanted to reset those values to the `Default` color
scheme, they could hit a reset button which would call the colorScheme `reset`
mutation and vuex-reset would restore the initial color scheme. Check out a demo
(of a different example) here:
