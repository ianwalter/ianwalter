# Monorepos for Next.js apps

Using a monorepo can be an effective way to simplify your development workflows
when developing multiple packages and applications. Here is how I set up
monorepos and how I get Next.js apps to be able to use shared code in a common
diretory within the monorepo.

## Yarn Workspaces

I use a feature of Yarn called Yarn Workspaces to be able to use modules within
the monorepo as if they are npm/node modules but without the having to do
anything when the code gets updated. It's kind of like `yarn link` without ever
having to publish the modules. I add something like the following to the root
`package.json` file:

```json
"workspaces": [
  "apps/*",
  "packages/*",
  "lib/*"
]
```

I use the apps directory for full web applications or services. I use the
packages directory for any packages that I want to develop within the monorepo
for convenience but also want to publish as npm packages and use elsewhere. I
use the lib directory for shared code, so for example, I would have a directory
called `lib/shared` with shared components and utilities. Then I'm able to
reference that module in apps like this:

```js
import TextField from 'shared/components/fields/TextField.js'
```

## Next.js configuration

It takes a bit of configuration to be able to use the shared library with
Next.js apps. First, you'll need to install `next-transpile-modules`. Then add
something like the following to your `next.config.js`:

```js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['shared'])

module.exports = withTM({
  // Your Next.js configuration goes here.
}))
```
