# Check a DNS record value on macOS using the command-line

I was manually renewing a SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt using DNS
verification and needed to verify that the DNS record had been updated before
continuing the process:

```bash
host -t TXT <domain>
```

Make sure to change `TXT` to whatever record type you're looking for, e.g.
`CNAME`, `A`, etc.
